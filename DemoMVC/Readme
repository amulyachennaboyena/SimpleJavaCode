Develop an application which deals with processing an order.

1.Customer will place an order. The order details includes
productId for which the order placed and quantity required.

2. Application should take the order details and process 
the order by checking whether the stock is available in 
the inventory or not. If there is sufficient then the 
application is supposed to update stock quantity in the 
inventory and display a message that the order is processed
else print a message "unable to process the order".

Note : In the inventory there can several products, the 
application should store the product details.

Example :
	If the company sells 10 different products, the application
	should have the details about the product like id,name,price 
	description and available quantity in the inventory.
	
	Use an array to store the product details.

Order
	int orderId
	int productId
	int quantity
	//getter and setters

Product
	id
	name
	price
	description
	quantity
	//getter and setters

OrderService
	processOrder(Order)
		read the productid from order object and fetch
		the details about the product from the array
		based on the productid.
		
		check whether the orderquantity is available 
		int inventory by comparing the available quantity 
		in the object. If there is sufficient then the 
		application is supposed to update stock quantity
		in the inventory and display a message that the 
		order is processed else print a message 
		"unable to process the order".

		class OrderService{
			private ProductDBStore productDBStore;
			
			public void processOrder(Order order){
				
			}
			
		}
		
		
		
		

ProductDBStore
	product array
	
	constructor(){
